This is a sample program for our DGEMM implementation on a Cypress GPU.
ALL.pdf explains how we implement four variants of DGEMM routines in IL.

To build this program, you will need ATI Stream SDK and cblas.
We have tested this program on Ubuntu 10.04.1 LTS (x86_64) with
fglrx 8.77.5 (Aug 25 2010), and ATI Stream SDK 2.2 and gcc 4.4.3.
The tested GPU boards are Radeon 4850, Radeon 5870 and Firestream 9350.

We put test scripts under the "script" directory.
"./script/test_NN.sh" tests "NN" kernel etc.
